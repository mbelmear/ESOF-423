## Description:

## How to Obtain:

- The HRDC Maintenance Portal can be accessed via the following link: [HRDC Maintenance Portal](https://fphillips22.github.io/test-pages/).

## How to Fill Out This Form:

1. Navigate to the “Name” text box, which is the first box on the website. Enter your first and last name into this box.
